Kafka Streams
	Easy data processing and transformation library
	- data transformations
	- data enrichment
	- fraud detection
	- motiroing and alerting

	A stream is a sequence of immutable data records, that fully ordered, can be replayed, and is fault tolerant (think of a Kafka Topic as a parallel)

	A stream processor is a node in the processor topology. It transforms incoming streams, record by record, and may create a new stream from it

	A topology is a graph of processors chained together by streams
