Kafka Streams
	Easy data processing and transformation library
	- data transformations
	- data enrichment
	- fraud detection
	- motiroing and alerting

	A stream is a sequence of immutable data records, that fully ordered, can be replayed, and is fault tolerant (think of a Kafka Topic as a parallel)

	A stream processor is a node in the processor topology. It transforms incoming streams, record by record, and may create a new stream from it

	A topology is a graph of processors chained together by streams

Streaming SQL Engine for Apache Kafka

Confluent ksqlDB has become an increasingly popular stream processing framework built upon Kafka Streams. It enables developers to write real-time stream processing applications with the ease of SQL. 



A stream is a sequence of immutable data records, that fully ordered, can be replayed, and is fault tolerant. 
In the Apache Kafka we can easily data transformations, enrichment, fraud detection using Kafka Streams when producing messages in a topic.
And with KSQL It enables developers to write real-time stream processing applications with the ease of SQL.

Version 4
A stream is a sequence of immutable data records, that fully ordered, can be replayed, and is fault tolerant. 
In Apache Kafka we can easily data transformations, enrichment, fraud detection using Kafka Streams and with KSQL we can write real-time stream processing applications with the ease of SQL.

---
A stream is a sequence of immutable data records, which are fully ordered, reproducible and fault tolerant.
At Apache Kafka, we can easily transform data, enrich, detect fraud using Kafka Streams and, with KSQL, we can write real-time flow processing applications with the ease of SQL.

---
Version 6
A stream is a sequence of immutable data records, that fully ordered, can be replayed, and is fault tolerant. 
In Apache Kafka, we can easily transform data, enrich, detect fraud using Kafka Streams and, with KSQL, we can write real-time stream processing applications with the ease of SQL.
